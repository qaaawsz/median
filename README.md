# Median - Where good ideas find you
This application is a Medium clone built using such technologies as `Next.js`, `React`, \
`Javascript`, `Typescript`, `TailWind CSS`, `Sanity CMS`. This application is **fully \
responsive** and consist of two pages:
#### **Main**
This page consists of **article previews** that are rendered as **links**, every link leads to \
**exact** article page
#### **Articles**
The Article page is rendered using **incremental static regeneration**, which is \
one of the most important `Next.js` features. Each page consists of **article** itself and \
**commentary block** below, which is **working** and allows to leave comments. \
Each added comment should be **firstly** approved by the owner or administrators.
